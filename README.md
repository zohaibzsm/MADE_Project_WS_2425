### How do demographic factors like age, sex, and income influence health insurance charges/coverage across different states/regions?

The project addresses the issue of healthcare inequality/discrimination of services across different demographic groups in America. For this problem we seek to address the relation between disparities/factors like income, age, gender, region/location and Health care charges/coverage that may lead to this unhealthy behavior. The insights aim to uncover the demographic groups(that face significant barriers) or the factors that are the cause to this healthcare accessibilty and treatment.

## Title
Demographic Disparities in Healthcare Accessibility and Outcomes in America

## Main Question
How do healthcare accessibility(such as Insurance Coverage, Income level, employment status, and poverty rate) in America vary across different demographic groups, and what factors contribute to these disparities?

## Description
This problem is important because there is an issue of inequality of healthcare services across different demographic groups in America. This problem will be addressed by identifying the disparities/factors like income, age, employment, and location that may lead to this unhealthy behavior. The insights can uncover the groups/factors that face significant barriers to healthcare accessibilty and treatment by discovering the appropriate factors.

# Project Plan

## Title
Relationship between Demographics and Healthcare Accessibility in America

## Main Question
How do demographic factors like age, sex, and income influence health insurance charges/coverage across different states/regions?

## Description
This problem is important because there is an issue of inequality/discrimination of healthcare services across different demographic groups in America. This problem will be addressed by identifying the relation between disparities/factors like income, age, gender, employment, region/location and Health care charges/coverage that may lead to this unhealthy behavior. The insights aim to uncover the demographic groups that face significant barriers to healthcare accessibilty and treatment.

## Title
Demographic Disparities in Healthcare Accessibility in America

## Main Question
What factors contribute to the healthcare accessibility disparities in America across different demographic groups such as Insurance Coverage, Income level, employment status, and poverty rate?

## Description
This problem is important because there is an issue of inequality/discrimination of healthcare services across different demographic groups in America. This problem will be addressed by identifying the disparities/factors like income, age, employment, and/or location that may lead to this unhealthy behavior. The insights aim to uncover the factors that face significant barriers to healthcare accessibilty and treatment by discovering the appropriate factors.
